# Strike System
### Our community uses a universal strike system for handling infractions, both in-game and on Discord. Here's how it works:

> **1st Strike:** A minor warning or short ban, depending on the offense.

> **2nd Strike:** The second strike can also be a shorter ban, but depending on the infraction, it may be longer.

> **3rd Strike:** If you've received your 3rd strike, you are usually on the edge of being unsuitable for our community. This doesn't essentially mean that you are to be permanently banned, but not very far from being so.

> **4th Strike:** Permanently banned from our server/servers. May still be allowed to be part of our discord, depending on the infraction

*Please note that the strike system is universal. This basically means that if you've committed an offense, received a strike and then proceeded to make another offense at a later date, you will be receiving your next strike in line, regardless of the offense.*

** Severe infractions like racism, cheating, or exploiting can result in harsher penalties regardless of strike level.
__Staff have the discretion to make final decisions in all cases.**__

*We are working on a system where the strikes expire after a certain amount of time. This will most likely be introduced after our 1.0 update.*
