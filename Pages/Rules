# **__✪ KOTH Reforged In-Game Rules__**
‎ 
> ### **1.0) TEAM KILLING:**
> Killing teammates on purpose, whether that is by shooting them, running them over or crashing a helicopter on purpose is not allowed. Retaliatory teamkilling will be punishable just the same and both will result in possible bans.
>  
> ### **1.1) SPAWN CAMPING:**
> Spawn camping is restricted to ensure fair play and maintain the integrity of the game. The following rules apply:
>  
> General Rule: Players are permitted to be in proximity to the enemy base or safe zone but must maintain a moderate distance. This distance is generally considered to be approximately 400 meters. Players must not enter the enemy base or safe zone and should avoid having a direct line of sight into the safe zone.
> 
> Small Maps: On smaller maps, where the spawn zones are within 400 meters of the main play area, players should focus their activity around the scoring circle or central objectives. Camping near spawn zones in these cases is strictly prohibited.
> 
> Special Scenarios: On maps with unique layouts, such as an airport runway with a clear line of sight to the spawn zone at 900 meters, it is still considered spawn camping if players have a direct line of sight to the spawn zone or safe zone. In such cases, players must adjust their positions to eliminate direct visibility into these areas.
> 
> Helicopter vs Helicopter Interaction: Shooting at helicopters that are exiting the 400m spawn protection zone, even if you're outside the protection zone and don't have line of sight to the enemy spawn is considered a rule violation. - You are therefore not allowed to camp just outside the enemy spawn, waiting for helicopters to leave spawn protection. This is reviewed in a case by case basis.
> 
> ### **1.2) DAMAGING / RAMMING TEAM VEHICLES:**
> Do not purposely shoot or ram any type of team vehicle, in or out of spawn otherwise it may result in a ban. You can ram enemy vehicles but only with cars and trucks.
> 
> ### **1.2b) ABUSING SPAWNPROTECTION:**
> Engaging enemies from within your own spawn's safezone is prohibited. Players must leave the safezone before participating in combat. Do not use safezone as cover while attacking. Exit the safezone completely to engage in combat. You may only return to the safezone when out of combat.
> 
> ### **1.3) HELI-RAMMING:**
> Using a helicopter to ram enemy or team vehicles purposely is strictly forbidden and will result in a possible ban. You are allowed to ram enemy helicopters with trucks or cars.
> 
> You may use your helicopter/vehicle to directly hit enemies if the helicopter/vehicle does not blow up. Any form of kamikaze and or suicide with a helicopter is not allowed.
> 
> ### **1.4) TROLLING / GRIEFING / MINGING:**
> Intentionally doing such things as body blocking, revealing another team members position by shooting or talking in-game with the intent to ruin their experience, entering enemy safe zones, and abusing the radio/VON are all not tolerated. Anything done intentionally to handicap another player’s experience shall be seen as Trolling/Griefing/Minging and will result in a ban.
> 
> ### **1.5) STREAM SNIPING:**
> Using a person’s stream and the information you gain from it to gain a tactical advantage or to troll them, kill them etc is strictly forbidden and will result in a ban.
> ### **1.6) GHOSTING/META GAMING:**
> Sharing information on your own teammates or using shared information on your friends’ teammates to gain a tactical advantage is forbidden and will result in a possible ban.
> 
> ### **1.7) SPAMMING:**
> Repeating the same message three or more times in a row or flooding the chat with three or more short messages in a row is not tolerated.
>  
> ### **1.8) PROHIBITED MESSAGES, LINKS & VC:**
> Racism, homo- and/or transphobia, pornographic links, advertising another discord or server, linking, or talking about disturbing content is strictly forbidden and will result in long terms bans. Toxicity, harassment, name calling, sexism, derogatory remarks, directed excessive profanity, vulgarities, insults and hate speech and anything as such are all not tolerated and will lead to possible bans as well. 
> 
> ### **1.9) EXPLOITING:**
> The use of a bug or a glitch, or the use of elements within the game in a manner not intended by us, in a way that gives a substantial unfair advantage is not tolerated and will result in long term bans. 
>  
> ### **2.0) CHEATING:**
> Using external injectable or executable software to gain an advantage such as aimbot, ESP, no recoil, speed-hacks etc will result in immediate bans.
> 
> ### **2.1) BAN EVADING:**
> Evading a ban (Cheating/Exploiting, Severe Trolling, etc) you have received by using an alternate account or platform to join back will result in permanent bans on all accounts involved.
> 
> ### **2.2) INAPPROPRIATE OR PROHIBITED NAMES:**
> Any in-game names that are invisible, enlarged and or have any racial slurs or offensive words within them are strictly forbidden and we will ask you to change your name. Failure to change your name will result in a ban until you have changed your name, where you can appeal with evidence of the name change on our discord.
>
> ### **) PLEASE READ:**
> We are unable to list all the possible rules that should be followed and thus we urge you strongly to use your common sense where possible before performing a questionable action.
> 
> Ban appeals for permanent bans are not something we are prioritizing at the moment. But will be part of this project once the 1.0 update comes out. Temporary bans are allowed to be appealed.
> 
> Staff have final say in all instances and will be looking at everything objectively.
> 
> If you wish to report staff abuse, please contact the staff manager or any member of the senior management team***
